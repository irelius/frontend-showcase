Hello, this is my Frontend Showcase, a project with the purpose of implementing and demonstrating a variety of frontend development practices and components, all done with React.

This project is still a work in progress, but it is planned to have features such as:
- Advanced CSS for styling
- Media queries
- Third party APIs (e.g. weather, stock, maps, payment gateways)
- Real-time communication with Socket.io
    - As well as other websockets
- Reusable and modular components for proper DRY practice
